MRMC
============

MRMC is a model checker for discrete-time and continuous-time Markov
reward models. It supports reward extensions of PCTL and CSL (PRCTL
and CSRL), and allows for the automated verification of properties
concerning long-run and instantaneous rewards as well as cumulative
rewards.
