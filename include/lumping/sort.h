/**
* The function refines a block according to the floating point numbers in key.
* It splits the block into subsets; each subset consists of states that have
* (almost) the same key value.
* Parameters: P = partition
*	B = block to be refined;
*	key = array of doubles (key[s] = value for state s).
*	set_b = TRUE if the array P->states[...].b has to be set to the correct
*		value;
*	largest = largest block found until now. may be NULL.
* Result: the largest block found (either the parameter largest or a larger
*	block). NULL if some error has happened.
